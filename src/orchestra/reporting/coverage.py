"""Build per-pipeline migration-coverage rows from the discover-phase metadata.

Joins the two artifacts the discover phase writes into ``<output_dir>/metadata/``:

* ``profile_report.csv`` -- per-pipeline complexity (activity/dataset/linked-service
  counts, collapsible patterns, activity-category counts, complexity score + size).
* ``inventory.json`` -- per-activity translation strategy, from which the
  deterministic / agentic / unsupported counts and coverage % are derived.

The result is one metric row per pipeline (no run metadata -- ``run_id`` /
``run_date`` / ``run_by`` are stamped on at write time by :mod:`reporting.results`).
