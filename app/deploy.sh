# Deploy the orchestra MCP server as a Databricks App.
#
# Builds a self-contained source bundle (app entrypoint + vendored orchestra
# package), syncs it to the workspace, and creates/deploys the app.
#
# Requirements: Databricks CLI v0.230+ authenticated to the target workspace.
#
# Env overrides:
#   APP_NAME            App name (default: mcp-orchestra). Keep the `mcp-` prefix —
#                       Databricks only surfaces apps named `mcp-*` under AI Gateway > MCPs.
#   APP_SOURCE_PATH     Workspace source path the app deploys from (default:
#                       /Workspace/Shared/<APP_NAME>). It MUST be readable by the app's
#                       service principal, so it defaults to /Workspace/Shared — NOT a user's
#                       private /Workspace/Users/<me> home, which the app SP cannot read.
#   DATABRICKS_PROFILE  CLI profile to use (default: env/DEFAULT auth)

# Stage the bundle OUTSIDE the repo. `databricks sync` is git-aware and applies the
# enclosing repo's .gitignore: a staging dir inside the repo (e.g. app/.build, which
# .gitignore lists) gets its files excluded, so the deployed source is missing app.py
# and orchestra/. A temp dir has no enclosing git repo / .gitignore, so every file syncs.
#
# The CLI is also bundle-aware: if a databricks.yml is discoverable in the working
# directory or any parent (e.g. a generated orchestra_output/databricks.yml), `sync` /
# `apps deploy` load it and fail with "Error: please specify target". Running from the
# (databricks.yml-free) staging dir avoids that too. All CLI paths are absolute.
#
# Create the staging dir in a writable location, trying the repo's PARENT first. On
# Databricks (Genie web terminal / serverless) the repo lives on the writable /Workspace
# filesystem while /tmp and $TMPDIR are often unwritable — a bare `mktemp -d` there fails
# with "mkdir: cannot create directory ...: Permission denied". The repo's parent
# (e.g. /Workspace/Shared) is writable AND outside the git repo, so staging there both
# succeeds and avoids the repo's .gitignore (which would otherwise make `databricks sync`
# drop staged files). $TMPDIR/tmp/$HOME are fallbacks for local (non-Databricks) runs.
