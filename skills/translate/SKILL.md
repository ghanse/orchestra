# Translate ADF to Databricks IR

Convert the parsed ADF inventory into Databricks intermediate representation (IR) using deterministic translators for known types and agentic fallback for complex/unknown types.

## Context

This is phase 2 of the orchestra migration workflow. It consumes the `inventory.json` produced by the `ingest` skill and produces a `translation_report.json` that the `prepare` skill uses to generate Databricks Declarative Automation Bundles.

The translation follows a **deterministic-first** strategy:
1. Activities with known, well-defined mappings are translated by built-in Python translators (fast, reliable, no LLM needed)
2. Activities that require interpretation, complex expression conversion, or lack a direct mapping are handled by agentic skills from the `adf-to-databricks-plugin` (LLM-assisted)

This approach maximizes reliability while covering the long tail of ADF activity types.

## Workflow

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1 — Locate the inventory

Read `inventory.json` from the ingest phase. If the path is not already in conversation context, ask the user:

> Where is the inventory.json from the ingest phase? (default: `./orchestra_output/ingest/inventory.json`)

Validate the file exists and is well-formed.

### Step 2 — Run deterministic translation

Execute the translation engine on all deterministic activities:

```bash
python3 <plugin_dir>/lib/orchestra/translator/engine.py \
  --inventory <inventory_path> \
  --source-dir <adf_source_dir> \
  --output-dir <output_dir>
```

Where:
- `<plugin_dir>` is the root of the orchestra plugin
- `<inventory_path>` is the path to `inventory.json`
- `<adf_source_dir>` is the original ADF JSON directory (from the ingest phase)
- `<output_dir>` is where to write translation output (default: `./orchestra_output/translate/`)

This produces:
- `translation_report.json` — results for deterministic activities + placeholders for agentic gaps
- `ir/` directory — the Databricks IR for each translated activity
- `notebooks/` directory — any generated helper notebooks

### Step 3 — Read the translation report

Read `translation_report.json`. It has this structure:

```json
{
  "inventory_path": "/path/to/inventory.json",
  "generated_at": "2026-04-07T12:30:00Z",
  "translations": [
    {
      "pipeline": "ETL_Main",
      "activity": "CopyFromBlob",
      "type": "Copy",
      "strategy": "deterministic",
      "status": "translated",
      "ir": {
        "task_key": "copy_from_blob",
        "task_type": "notebook_task",
        "notebook_path": "notebooks/copy_from_blob.py",
        "parameters": { "source": "abfss://...", "target": "..." }
      }
    },
    {
      "pipeline": "ETL_Main",
      "activity": "TransformData",
      "type": "ExecuteDataFlow",
      "strategy": "agentic",
      "status": "pending",
      "raw_activity_json": { "...": "..." },
      "target_skill": "adf-to-databricks:adf-dataflow-converter"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 47,
    "deterministic_translated": 35,
    "agentic_pending": 10,
    "failed": 2
  }
}
```

### Step 4 — Handle agentic gaps

For each translation with `"status": "pending"` and `"strategy": "agentic"`, invoke the appropriate skill from the `adf-to-databricks-plugin`. Route by activity type:

**ExecuteDataFlow activities:**
Invoke `adf-to-databricks:adf-dataflow-converter` with the raw activity JSON and associated data flow definition. Provide context:
- The raw `typeProperties` from the ADF activity
- The data flow JSON definition (if available in the source directory under `dataflow/`)
- The linked service configurations for source/sink connections
- Target catalog and schema for the DLT pipeline or PySpark notebook output

**Control flow activities (Switch, Until, Wait, Filter, AppendVariable):**
Invoke `adf-to-databricks:adf-pipeline-converter` with the raw activity JSON. Provide context:
- The full pipeline JSON containing the activity
- Any nested activities within the control flow
- Variable definitions from the pipeline
- The desired Databricks task type mapping

**Stored procedures and external calls (SqlServerStoredProcedure, AzureFunction, WebHook, Custom):**
Invoke `adf-to-databricks:adf-pipeline-converter` with the raw activity JSON. Provide context:
- The linked service configuration for the target system
- Connection details and authentication method
- Any parameters or request bodies

**Complex expressions:**
If any activity (deterministic or agentic) contains ADF expressions that the deterministic translator could not resolve, invoke `adf-to-databricks:adf-expression-translator` with:
- The raw expression string (e.g., `@pipeline().parameters.inputPath`)
- The expression context (pipeline parameters, variables, activity outputs)
- The target format (Python f-string, Spark SQL, task parameter reference)

**Trigger definitions:**
Invoke `adf-to-databricks:adf-trigger-converter` with:
- The trigger JSON definition
- The associated pipeline references
- Target: Databricks job schedule configuration (quartz_cron_expression, periodic, or file_arrival)

### Step 5 — Collect agentic results

Each agentic skill invocation produces a translation result. Collect all results into `<output_dir>/agentic_results/`:
- Save each result as `<pipeline>__<activity>.json`
- Include the generated IR, any notebooks, and metadata

### Step 6 — Merge agentic results

Run the merge step to combine deterministic and agentic translations:

```bash
python3 <plugin_dir>/lib/orchestra/translator/engine.py \
  --merge-agentic \
  --report <translation_report_path> \
  --agentic-results <agentic_results_dir>
```

This updates `translation_report.json` with the agentic results merged in, changing their status from `pending` to `translated` (or `failed` if the agentic skill could not produce a result).

### Step 7 — Present translation summary

Display a summary to the user:

```
Translation Summary
===================
Total activities:           47
Deterministic translated:   35 (74.5%)
Agentic translated:          8 (17.0%)
Failed:                      4 ( 8.5%)

Overall coverage:           91.5%

Failed translations:
  - ETL_Main / RunSSIS (ExecuteSSISPackage) — no translator available
  - ETL_Main / CustomTask (Custom) — agentic skill returned error
  ...

Generated artifacts:
  - translation_report.json
  - ir/ (43 files)
  - notebooks/ (12 files)
```

If coverage is below 100%, explain the options for failed translations:
1. Manual notebook creation for unsupported types
2. Retry agentic translation with additional context
3. Skip the activity and add a placeholder task in the DAB
