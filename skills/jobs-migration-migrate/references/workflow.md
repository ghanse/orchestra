# Orchestra Migration Workflow

End-to-end architecture for migrating Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines to Databricks Lakeflow Jobs via Declarative Automation Bundles (DABs).

## Overview

Orchestra follows a three-phase pipeline architecture. Each phase is independently runnable and produces artifacts consumed by the next phase. The design principle is **deterministic-first, agentic fallback**: well-known ADF patterns are translated by fast, reliable Python code, while complex or ambiguous patterns are handled by LLM-assisted skills.

## Phase 1: Discover

**Skill:** `orchestra:jobs-migration-discover`

**Input:** Directory of ADF JSON export files (from ARM template export, Azure DevOps, or manual export)

**Process:**
1. Discover and parse all JSON files (pipelines, datasets, linked services, triggers)
2. Build a typed AST for each pipeline, resolving activity references
3. Classify every activity into a translation strategy:
   - **Deterministic** — a built-in translator handles this type
   - **Agentic** — requires LLM-assisted translation
   - **Unsupported** — no known translation path
4. Generate the inventory with summary statistics

**Output:**
- `inventory.json` — classified activity inventory
- `ast/*.json` — typed AST per pipeline
- `parse_errors.json` — any parsing failures

**Key decisions:**
- Classification is based on the activity `type` field, not the activity content. This makes classification fast and deterministic.
- Datasets and linked services are parsed for context but not independently translated — they inform the activity translators.
- Triggers are included in the inventory and translated in phase 2.

## Phase 2: Convert

**Skill:** `orchestra:jobs-migration-convert`

**Input:** `inventory.json` from phase 1 + original ADF JSON files

**Process:**
1. Run deterministic translators for all activities classified as `deterministic`
2. For each `agentic` activity, invoke the appropriate skill from the `adf-to-databricks-plugin`:
   - `adf-dataflow-converter` for ExecuteDataFlow activities
   - `adf-pipeline-converter` for control flow and external call activities
   - `adf-expression-translator` for complex ADF expression conversion
   - `adf-trigger-converter` for trigger schedule translation
3. Merge deterministic and agentic results into a unified translation report
4. Generate Databricks IR (intermediate representation) for each activity

**Output:**
- `translation_report.json` — unified report with IR for all activities
- `ir/*.json` — Databricks IR per activity
- `notebooks/*.py` — generated helper notebooks
- `agentic_results/*.json` — raw agentic skill outputs

**Key decisions:**
- Deterministic translators run first because they are fast and reliable. Agentic skills are only invoked for gaps.
- The IR is an intermediate format that decouples translation from DABs generation. This allows the package phase to target different output formats in the future.
- Each deterministic translator is a standalone Python module in `src/orchestra/translator/activity_translators/`. Adding support for a new activity type means adding a new module.
- Agentic results are saved separately before merging, so they can be inspected, retried, or manually overridden.

## Phase 3: Package

**Skill:** `orchestra:jobs-migration-package`

**Input:** `translation_report.json` from phase 2

**Process:**
1. Read the unified translation report
2. For each pipeline, generate a Databricks Lakeflow Job definition (YAML)
3. Map ADF activity dependencies to DABs task dependencies
4. Generate the `databricks.yml` root configuration with target environments
5. Copy/generate notebooks to `src/notebooks/`
6. Generate setup scripts for infrastructure (volumes, secrets, connections)
7. Generate skeleton test files

**Output:**
- Complete DABs project ready for `databricks bundle validate` and `databricks bundle deploy`

**Key decisions:**
- One Databricks Job per ADF pipeline. Activities within a pipeline become tasks within the job.
- ADF dependency chains (`dependsOn`) are mapped to DABs task dependencies.
- Environment-specific values (catalog, schema, warehouse ID) are parameterized as bundle variables.
- Three default targets: dev, staging, prod. Each can have different variable values.
- Setup scripts are generated but not run automatically — the user must review and run them.

## Design Principles

### Deterministic-first, agentic fallback

The majority of ADF activities (Copy, DatabricksNotebook, ForEach, IfCondition, etc.) have well-defined Databricks equivalents. Building deterministic translators for these ensures:
- **Speed** — no LLM calls needed for 70-80% of activities
- **Reliability** — same input always produces same output
- **Testability** — translators are unit-testable Python functions
- **Cost** — no token consumption for the bulk of translation

Agentic skills handle the remaining 20-30% that require interpretation or generation. This is where LLM reasoning adds value — complex data flows, exotic activity types, expression conversion.

### Phased execution with checkpoints

Each phase produces a persistent artifact (`inventory.json`, `translation_report.json`, DABs project). This allows:
- **Resumability** — if a phase fails, restart from that phase
- **Inspection** — review intermediate artifacts before proceeding
- **Modularity** — run phases independently or skip phases
- **Debugging** — trace issues back to specific phases

### IR as decoupling layer

The Databricks IR (intermediate representation) sits between ADF semantics and DABs output. This decouples:
- **Parsing** — understanding ADF JSON structure
- **Semantic mapping** — translating ADF concepts to Databricks concepts
- **Serialization** — writing DABs YAML and notebooks

This means the package phase could target different output formats (Terraform, raw API calls, etc.) without changing the translation logic.

## ADF Concepts to Databricks Mapping

| ADF Concept | Databricks Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Pipeline | Lakeflow Job |
| Activity | Job Task |
| Activity dependency (`dependsOn`) | Task dependency (`depends_on`) |
| Pipeline parameter | Job parameter |
| Pipeline variable | Task value |
| Linked service | Unity Catalog connection or secret scope |
| Dataset | Unity Catalog table/volume path |
| Data flow | DLT pipeline or PySpark notebook |
| Trigger (schedule) | Job schedule (`quartz_cron_expression`) |
| Trigger (tumbling window) | Job schedule (periodic) |
| Trigger (event) | File arrival trigger |
| Integration runtime | Job cluster or serverless compute |

## Error Handling

- **Parse errors** — logged to `parse_errors.json`, skipped in inventory
- **Translation failures** — marked as `failed` in translation report, get placeholder tasks in DABs
- **Agentic failures** — saved with error details, can be retried with additional context
- **Unsupported activities** — warned at discover, get placeholder tasks with TODO comments in DABs
