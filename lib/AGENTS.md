# Library Code Conventions

Companion to the top-level [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) (architecture).  This
file documents *code-style* expectations for everything under
`lib/orchestra/`.  When in doubt, match the existing code in the
neighbouring module.

## Naming

- **No abbreviated identifiers.**  Use full descriptive names: `notebook`
  not `nb`, `destination` not `dest`, `context` not `ctx`,
  `type_properties` not `tp`, `linked_service` not `ls`, `keyword` not
  `kw`.  Single-letter loop counters (`i`, `j`, `k`) are fine; `e` for an
  exception is fine; `df` for a Spark DataFrame in *generated user-facing
  notebook code* is fine.
- **Module-private names start with `_`.**  Anything imported by another
  module must not have a leading underscore -- promote it to public (or
  move it to a more appropriate module) instead of importing a private
  name.
- **Constants in `UPPER_SNAKE`** (e.g. `JDBC_SOURCE_TYPES`); modules and
  functions in `lower_snake`; classes in `PascalCase`.

## Docstrings

- First line is **third-person present indicative** describing what the
  function does: ``"""Converts X to Y."""`` rather than ``"""Convert
  X..."""`` or ``"""This function converts..."""``.
- Keep docstrings **brief** -- usually one sentence.  Add extra detail
  only when behaviour is non-obvious (edge cases, surprising
  invariants).  Don't restate the type signature or repeat parameter
  names; ``Args:`` / ``Returns:`` / ``Raises:`` blocks are optional and
  should appear only when the type is genuinely ambiguous.
- Don't write multi-paragraph design rationale in docstrings; that
  belongs in commit messages or pull-request descriptions.

## Comments

- The bar is: **could a new developer trace through this codebase and
  understand the line without the comment?**  If yes, delete the comment.
- Comments explain **why** -- a constraint, a non-obvious invariant, a
  reference to an external spec, a prior bug being avoided.  They never
  restate **what** the code does.
- Prefer a self-documenting variable or function name over a comment.
- One-line comments only; multi-line block comments are a smell.

## Imports

- **Top-level only.**  Inline imports inside function bodies are allowed
  only when avoiding a real circular import.  When you do need one, add a
  one-line comment naming the cycle.
- **No pointless aliases.**  Don't write ``import json as _json`` or
  ``from x import Y as _Y`` unless an alias is genuinely required to
  avoid a name collision.
- **No cross-module private imports.**  If module A needs a name from
  module B, that name lives at the top level of B without a leading
  underscore.  Lazy or circular cases should use a public re-export.

## Mutability

- **Models are immutable by convention.**  All dataclasses use
  ``@dataclass(slots=True, kw_only=True)``.  Frozen dataclasses are
  preferred when the type carries no internal mutation.
- **Collections accumulated across helpers should be returned, not
  mutated.**  Helpers that "fold up" results (e.g.
  :class:`PreparedArtifacts`) take an immutable accumulator and return a
  new one rather than mutating shared lists.
- ``TranslationContext`` is **never modified in place** -- always return
  a new instance via ``context.with_*(...)``.

## Function shape

- Keep functions short.  When a function grows past ~40 lines or 3
  levels of nesting, extract a private helper.
- Use **guard clauses** (early ``return``/``continue``) instead of
  building deep ``if`` pyramids.
- Prefer comprehensions and generator expressions over explicit
  ``for``-append loops when the comprehension fits on one screen line.

## Duplication

- Two near-identical 4-6 line blocks inside a single module: extract a
  module-private helper.
- The same block across modules: extract to a public helper in the most
  semantically appropriate module (often
  ``orchestra/utils.py`` or
  ``orchestra/preparer/activity_preparers/helpers.py``).

## Tests

- Every translator and preparer module has a corresponding ``tests/unit/``
  test file.  When adding a new helper, add a unit test for it.
- Tests run with ``make test``; integration tests run with
  ``make integration`` (require ADF fixtures).
- Behavioural changes must be verified by checking that bundle YAML
  output for the verdi-test fixtures is byte-identical (or, if it
  differs, that the diff matches the intended change).

## Tooling

- ``make fmt`` runs ``ruff format``, ``ruff check --fix``, and ``mypy``.
- Line length is 120 characters.
- Python 3.12+ syntax is OK (e.g. ``dict[str, Any]`` over
  ``Dict[str, Any]``, ``X | None`` over ``Optional[X]``).
